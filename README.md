# Idea Box in React

[Project Guidelines for Idea Box](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)
Idea Box was a project I worked on in the first module for my school, Turing School of Software & Design. After finishing the second module, where we were introduced to the React library, I decided to redo the Idea Box project using React. This was a project to get myself more accustom to React. I became more familiar with passing variables and functions as props down to children components, which then pass data back up to the parent components.

## React Starter Kit

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
